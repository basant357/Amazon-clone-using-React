Businesses must acknowledge that everyone has gone online, and having a business means creating an online presence. Amazon is an excellent example of a website containing all the essential components of an effective e-commerce site. Through this project, we’ll learn how to use React to create a working replica of Amazon’s online store.
When someone starts a new business for trading items, the first thing they do is convert their firm to e-commerce. Many companies want to use e-commerce as their sole way of operation. The possibility of e-commerce is practically endless, which is why we’ll embark on a journey to develop our own ecommerce solution. Prerequisites for this project are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
